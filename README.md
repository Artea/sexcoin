Development process
===================

Current efforts in the development of this coin are being made by a few members of bitcointalk.org that still have an interest in seeing it survive. These efforts are on a volunteer basis, so things will be a little slow for now. The original release of the coin by member 'chinsu' has been set as the current master. Updates for now will follow the litecoin (LTC) project. A clean base will be made available very soon as this is the first goal of current volunteer development team.

Next Client Release
===================

As of 09-2016, development has begun on the next release. Development branch is 0.10.4.0, based on Litecoin 0.10.4. Please see the wiki link on the github page for updates. Help is appreciated and encouraged. This will represent a large jump as far as the underpinnings of the sexcoin blockchain and network. Blocks will jump to V4, Testnet has been implemented, Multi-sig will be available. Coin-control will also be available.
